# Montgomery - time tracker

_"I guess this is the end. I just wish I'd spent more time at the office."_ - C. M. Burns.

## Brief
Let's see if I can write something for tracking my hours that is more usable than my current pen + paper solution!

1. **Must** allow me to enter project, task, day, time started and finished.
2. **Must** calculate daily sums for me, grouped by project then task.
3. _Should_ be available on my desktop and on my mobile device.
4. _Should_ be power-user friendly (keyboard shortcuts).
5. _Should_ be attractive.
6. Might have some nice visualizations of where all that time is going.

## Plans

### Roadmap
I'm going to tackle the targets in order, so v.0.0 will be target 1, etc..

### Technical choices
* Bower seems to be THE package manager for a web app.
* Bootstrap - what else?
* TypeScript - because I think I'm going to fall in love with it.
* QUnit - not likely to need much testing, mind.
* Blanket - not sure this is going to get complex enough to require code coverage, but if it does.
