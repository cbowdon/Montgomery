Montgomery - time tracker
=========================

_"I guess this is the end. I just wish I'd spent more time at the office."_ - C. M. Burns.

This is a yet another time tracking tool. The difference is that this one is built to my suit own personal workflow, and so to replace the (mostly very efficient) pen-and-paper system I currently use. It is a web app designed to work on multiple devices, and to support offline use.

## History
v1 is the version I'm actively using, v2 is the new hotness (work-in-progress). See PLAN.md for a sort of journal of what I'm up to here, technically.
